PLANT LEAF DISEASE DETECTION(TOMATO)
 
I have done this assignment in google colab as my jupyter notebook is not able work with tensor flow and its functions(my laptop is mac book).
This project is basically to predict an image of a leaf whether the leaf is healthy or not with the following names virus, infected etc.
For this i have imported a dataset from kaggle .
I have used CNN Model.
I have used the following libraries to train and test the model
Tensorflow
Keras
numpy 
pandas 
matplotlib
I have mostly used keras sub libraries such as Image Data Generator,Load image ,image_to_array
The model i have chosen is VGG19 for training and testing.
